# Pacman Game - My First Major Java Project

This is my first major project written in Java, created in 2024. It's a Pacman game where I applied various programming concepts and skills to bring this classic arcade game to life. The project allowed me to explore Java's object-oriented programming features, as well as enhance my understanding of game logic and user interface design.

Feel free to explore the code, and any feedback or suggestions are greatly appreciated!
